    - name: Overview
      pretext: The Woodland Alliance works to gain the **sympathy** of the various creatures of the Woodland who are dissatisfied with their present condition. Each time the Alliance places a sympathy token, they may score victory points. The more sympathy on the map they have, the more victory points they score. Gaining the sympathy of the people requires **supporters**. These supporters can also be put toward violent ends, inciting outright rebellion across the forest. When a revolt erupts, the Alliance will establish a **base**. Bases allow the Alliance to train officers, increasing their military flexibility.

  children:
    - name: Overview
      pretext: Catering to the discarded creatures of the Woodland, the Lizard Cult seeks to overwhelm its foes through sheer force of will. Wherever the Cult rules clearings, it can build **gardens**, using word of mouth and beak to spread its gospel to the animals living there. The firmer its hold over the hearts of its followers, the more victory points the Cult can score by completing the proper **rituals**. While other factions spend cards to achieve their aims, the Cult acts chiefly by revealing cards and gradually gathering a set of ideal followers. These revealed cards are returned to the Cult's hand in Evening, unless discarded to score victory points. However, this gentler approach makes movement and battle difficult-the Cult can only take these actions with its radicalized **acolytes**, gained as the Cult's warriors are slaughtered while defending in battle.

As other factions purchase their services, the Riverfolk can further entrench their commercial interested by building **trade posts** along the river, scoring victory points. So too can they score points by raw accumulation of **funds**, but a big treasury makes for an easy target, so the Riverfolk must take care in expanding their operations across the dangerous forest.
