  questions:
    - q: Which pieces are buildings? Which are tokens?
      a: Broadly, square cardboard pieces that go in slots are buildings, while circular cardboard pieces are tokens. You’ll find detailed lists of buildings and tokens on the back of the learn-to-play and the backs of the faction boards.
      laws: 
        - "2.5"
    
    - q: Do I lose points if one of my buildings is removed?
      a: Nope!
      laws: 
        - "2.5.2"

    - q: Can I play multiple ambush cards in a battle?
      a: Nope! Just one.
      laws: 
        - "4.3.1"

    - q: Do the Favor... cards really remove all enemy pieces from those clearings?
      a: Yes. Every single one—except the Vagabond, of course. What a sneaky guy.
      laws: 
        - "2.1"

    - q: How do I get rid of enemy tokens, like sympathy tokens?
      a: You battle them, like any other piece. You can also remove them with Favor cards. 
      laws:
        - "2.1"
        - "2.5"
        - "4.3"
    
    - q: Does placing a piece in a sympathetic clearing trigger Outrage?

        - "8.2.6"
        - "8.2.5"

    - q: Where do buildings and tokens go when removed?

      laws:
        - "2.5"

    - q: What does "activating" a piece for crafting mean? Do I do anything with it?
      a: Nope. Activating just means "I have it, and I want to use it for crafting." You don't need to get rid of it or do anything other than point at it and say, "I'm activating this to craft a card."
      laws:
        - "4.1.1"

      laws:
        - "6."

  questions:
    - q: Does Turmoil trigger if I have an empty column?
      a: Nope! Turmoil triggers if you have a card in your Decree that you can’t complete.
      laws:
        - "7.7"

    - q: Does Turmoil trigger if I can take actions for some but not all cards in a column?

      laws:
        - "7.7"

    - q: Can I move one warrior at a time from the same clearing to fulfill many Move cards in my Decree? Can I move the same warrior back and forth, given the right cards?

    - q: What does the Despot's ability do? Don't I already get a victory point for removing a building or token?

- category: Woodland Alliance
  color: "#68b653"
  questions:
    - q: Can I revolt with a base in a suit whose base I’ve already built?

      laws:
        - "8.4.1"

    - q: Can I revolt in the clearing with the keep token?
      a: Nope! You would have to place a sympathy token first, which you can’t do because of the Marquise’s special ability The Keep.

- category: Vagabond
  color: "#6d6e70"
  questions:
    - q: Can I craft cards with multiple-suit requirements?
      a: "No. Your hammers match your current clearing, so you can only craft with one suit at a time. Good news: the multi-suit cards are useless to you anyway!"
      laws:
        - "9.2.1"

    - q: Do I trigger the Alliance's Outrage when I move into a sympathetic clearing?

        - "9.2.2"

  questions:
    - q: When I hire Riverfolk mercenaries, can I start a battle with them even if I don’t have pieces in the clearing where I'm battling?
      a: Go for it! Plus, if you don't have any warriors there, there's no one to split hits with. 
      laws:
        - "11.2.7"
    
    - q: Can I export a card if the item on it is not in the supply or if I already have its permanent effect?
